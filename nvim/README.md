## Dependencies

This requires installing Nodejs and C++ compilers.
For Linux, they can be easily installed using your distro's package manager.
For Windows, you can install Nodejs using the official installer,
and install Microsoft Visual Studio Community Edition to install C++ compiler.

Additionally, if you want to use [lazygit](https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit)
within [toggleterm](https://github.com/akinsho/toggleterm.nvim),
you can use `winget` as described in the repo.
